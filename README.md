# Calculadora SJMA
 My Android calculator
 
 Still in progress but it's already functional.
 
 Play Store (open testing): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sjma11723.calculadorasjma
 
 Basically it works by processing the string written by the user and make the operations in the hierarchy of operations using Divide and Conquer algorithm (it can be represented as a binary tree).
